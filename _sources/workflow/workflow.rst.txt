Introduction
^^^^
In Jira we have 5 different issue types:

==================  =====
Issue Type          Hierarchy Level
==================  =====
``Brigade``             1
``Bug``                 2
``Task``                2
``Change Request``      3
``Investigation``       3
==================  =====

The numbers beside the issue type indicate the hierarchy level within the company.

Breakdown
^^^^
A ``Brigade`` *(1)* is a collection of tasks. This a top level concept.

An example of this would be:
    Get Infrared communication working

A ``Bug`` *(2)* is some issue that has been reported. A Bug's description will include exactly what the issue is and the steps to reproduce. A bug will trigger an ``Investigation`` sub-task.

A ``Task`` *(2)* is a specific task or feature that is part of the ``Brigade``. An example of this would be:

An example of this would be:
    Get Infrared communication working

A ``Change Request`` *(3)* specifies exactly how you would go about the task and what steps were required to attain a solution. It is the ultimate form of accountability. The unique ID generated for ``Change Requests`` is what is used to track your work. It is the branch name within the avo.git repo. An example of this would be:

An example of this would be:
    Use PWM's Input Capture mode to decode the IR signal received from the IR hardware module.

An ``Investigation`` *(3)* is some work where we are seeking knowledge or know-how for how to do a task or to figure out what is causing a bug.
